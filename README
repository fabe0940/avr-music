OVERVIEW
========

This program outputs a note between A3 and C5 whenever the corresponding key on
the keypad is pressed.


COMPILING
=========

To build this project, simply run the Make utility.

$ make


INSTALLING
==========

To install the code to the ATMega32, we once again use Make.

$ make install


HARDWARE
========

Attach PORTA to the speaker and PORTB to the keypad.


RUNNING
=======

The program will begin running automatically after running 'make install'. To
restart the program, hit the RESET switch on the development board.


SIZE
====

As part of this assignment, we were asked to determine the size in bytes of
each function used in this project. This data is most easily presented in a
table.

+-------------------------+------+
| FUNCTION                | SIZE |
+-------------------------+------+
| key_init                |   34 |
| key_get_char            |  252 |
| _lcd_get_data           |    4 |
| _lcd_set_ctrl           |   18 |
| _lcd_set_ctrl_mode      |    4 |
| _lcd_set_data           |    4 |
| _lcd_set_data_mode      |    4 |
| _lcd_read               |   48 |
| _lcd_wait               |   12 |
| _lcd_write              |   72 |
| lcd_init                |   66 |
| lcd_clear               |   14 |
| lcd_power               |   24 |
| lcd_putchar             |   50 |
| timer_init              |   50 |
| timer_callback_none     |    2 |
| timer_callback_register |   18 |
| timer_callback_clear    |   26 |
| __vector_7              |   78 |
| init                    |   46 |
| main                    |   22 |
| handler_press           |  134 |
| handler_release         |    4 |
| handler_toggle          |   22 |
+-------------------------+------+

Each time the __vector_7 timer ISR is called, 81 assembly instructions are
executed. Depending on the note being played, this ISR is called somewhere
between every 1000 and every 2000 clock cycles. Taking a rough average of 1500
cycles, this means 5.4% of this program's execution is spent in the timer ISR.

Each note was approximately 15 to 20 percent sharp.
